A biologically plausible neural network for Slow Feature Analysis,"Learning latent features from time series data is an important problem in both machine learning and brain function. One approach, called Slow Feature Analysis (SFA), leverages the slowness of many salient features relative to the rapidly varying input signals. Furthermore, when trained on naturalistic stimuli, SFA reproduces interesting properties of cells in the primary visual cortex and hippocampus, suggesting that the brain uses temporal slowness as a computational principle for learning latent features. However, despite the potential relevance of SFA for modeling brain function, there is currently no SFA algorithm with a biologically plausible neural network implementation, by which we mean an algorithm operates in the online setting and can be mapped onto a neural network with local synaptic updates. In this work, starting from an SFA objective, we derive an SFA algorithm, called Bio-SFA, with a biologically plausible neural network implementation. We validate Bio-SFA on naturalistic stimuli.",37,16,0,5,4,33.0,217.0,9.0,0
"Convex Geometry of ReLU-layers, Injectivity on the Ball and Local Reconstruction","The paper uses a frame-theoretic setting to study the injectivity of a ReLU-layer on the closed ball of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and its non-negative part. In particular, the interplay between the radius of the ball and the bias vector is emphasized. Together with a perspective from convex geometry, this leads to a computationally feasible method of verifying the injectivity of a ReLU-layer under reasonable restrictions in terms of an upper bound of the bias vector. Explicit reconstruction formulas are provided, inspired by the duality concept from frame theory. All this gives rise to the possibility of quantifying the invertibility of a ReLU-layer and a concrete reconstruction algorithm for any input vector on the ball.",21,4,1,2,3,12.0,10.0,2.0,0
Classification with Conceptual Safeguards,"We propose a new approach to promote safety in classification tasks with established concepts. Our approach -- called a conceptual safeguard -- acts as a verification layer for models that predict a target outcome by first predicting the presence of intermediate concepts. Given this architecture, a safeguard ensures that a model meets a minimal level of accuracy by abstaining from uncertain predictions. In contrast to a standard selective classifier, a safeguard provides an avenue to improve coverage by allowing a human to confirm the presence of uncertain concepts on instances on which it abstains. We develop methods to build safeguards that maximize coverage without compromising safety, namely techniques to propagate the uncertainty in concept predictions and to flag salient concepts for human review. We benchmark our approach on a collection of real-world and synthetic datasets, showing that it can improve performance and coverage in deep learning tasks.",31,0,0,1,3,5.0,5.0,1.0,0
PAC-Bayes bounds for stable algorithms with instance-dependent priors,"PAC-Bayes bounds have been proposed to get risk estimates based on a training sample. In this paper the PAC-Bayes approach is combined with stability of the hypothesis learned by a Hilbert space valued algorithm. The PAC-Bayes setting is used with a Gaussian prior centered at the expected output. Thus a novelty of our paper is using priors defined in terms of the data-generating distribution. Our main result estimates the risk of the randomized algorithm in terms of the hypothesis stability coefficients. We also provide a new bound for the SVM classifier, which is compared to other known bounds experimentally. Ours appears to be the first stability-based bound that evaluates to non-trivial values.",28,53,2,7,5,16.0,489.0,9.0,0
Spikformer: When Spiking Neural Network Meets Transformer,"We consider two biologically plausible structures, the Spiking Neural Network (SNN) and the self-attention mechanism. The former offers an energy-efficient and event-driven paradigm for deep learning, while the latter has the ability to capture feature dependencies, enabling Transformer to achieve good performance. It is intuitively promising to explore the marriage between them. In this paper, we consider leveraging both self-attention capability and biological properties of SNNs, and propose a novel Spiking Self Attention (SSA) as well as a powerful framework, named Spiking Transformer (Spikformer). The SSA mechanism in Spikformer models the sparse visual feature by using spike-form Query, Key, and Value without softmax. Since its computation is sparse and avoids multiplication, SSA is efficient and has low computational energy consumption. It is shown that Spikformer with SSA can outperform the state-of-the-art SNNs-like frameworks in image classification on both neuromorphic and static datasets. Spikformer (66.3M parameters) with comparable size to SEW-ResNet-152 (60.2M,69.26%) can achieve 74.81% top1 accuracy on ImageNet using 4 time steps, which is the state-of-the-art in directly trained SNNs models.",74,171,36,3,7,7.0,207.0,3.0,1
LargeST: A Benchmark Dataset for Large-Scale Traffic Forecasting,"Road traffic forecasting plays a critical role in smart city initiatives and has experienced significant advancements thanks to the power of deep learning in capturing non-linear patterns of traffic data. However, the promising results achieved on current public datasets may not be applicable to practical scenarios due to limitations within these datasets. First, the limited sizes of them may not reflect the real-world scale of traffic networks. Second, the temporal coverage of these datasets is typically short, posing hurdles in studying long-term patterns and acquiring sufficient samples for training deep models. Third, these datasets often lack adequate metadata for sensors, which compromises the reliability and interpretability of the data. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce the LargeST benchmark dataset. It encompasses a total number of 8,600 sensors in California with a 5-year time coverage and includes comprehensive metadata. Using LargeST, we perform in-depth data analysis to extract data insights, benchmark well-known baselines in terms of their performance and efficiency, and identify challenges as well as opportunities for future research. We release the datasets and baseline implementations at: https://github.com/liuxu77/LargeST.",39,46,9,2,10,12.0,199.0,6.0,1
Robust Sub-Gaussian Principal Component Analysis and Width-Independent Schatten Packing,"We develop two methods for the following fundamental statistical task: given an $\epsilon$-corrupted set of $n$ samples from a $d$-dimensional sub-Gaussian distribution, return an approximate top eigenvector of the covariance matrix. Our first robust PCA algorithm runs in polynomial time, returns a $1 - O(\epsilon\log\epsilon^{-1})$-approximate top eigenvector, and is based on a simple iterative filtering approach. Our second, which attains a slightly worse approximation factor, runs in nearly-linear time and sample complexity under a mild spectral gap assumption. These are the first polynomial-time algorithms yielding non-trivial information about the covariance of a corrupted sub-Gaussian distribution without requiring additional algebraic structure of moments. As a key technical tool, we develop the first width-independent solvers for Schatten-$p$ norm packing semidefinite programs, giving a $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximate solution in $O(p\log(\tfrac{nd}{\epsilon})\epsilon^{-1})$ input-sparsity time iterations (where $n$, $d$ are problem dimensions).",41,40,3,5,3,45.0,592.0,16.0,0
Policy Certificates: Towards Accountable Reinforcement Learning,"The performance of a reinforcement learning algorithm can vary drastically during learning because of exploration. Existing algorithms provide little information about the quality of their current policy before executing it, and thus have limited use in high-stakes applications like healthcare. We address this lack of accountability by proposing that algorithms output policy certificates. These certificates bound the sub-optimality and return of the policy in the next episode, allowing humans to intervene when the certified quality is not satisfactory. We further introduce two new algorithms with certificates and present a new framework for theoretical analysis that guarantees the quality of their policies and certificates. For tabular MDPs, we show that computing certificates can even improve the sample-efficiency of optimism-based exploration. As a result, one of our algorithms is the first to achieve minimax-optimal PAC bounds up to lower-order terms, and this algorithm also matches (and in some settings slightly improves upon) existing minimax regret bounds.",51,138,16,7,4,47.0,1825.0,19.0,0
SMILe: Scalable Meta Inverse Reinforcement Learning through Context-Conditional Policies,"Imitation Learning (IL) has been successfully applied to complex sequential decision-making problems where standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms fail. A number of recent methods extend IL to few-shot learning scenarios, where a meta-trained policy learns to quickly master new tasks using limited demonstrations. However, although Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) often outperforms Behavioral Cloning (BC) in terms of imitation quality, most of these approaches build on BC due to its simple optimization objective. In this work, we propose SMILe, a scalable framework for Meta Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Meta-IRL) based on maximum entropy IRL, which can learn high-quality policies from few demonstrations. We examine the efficacy of our method on a variety of high-dimensional simulated continuous control tasks and observe that SMILe significantly outperforms Meta-BC. Furthermore, we observe that SMILe performs comparably or outperforms Meta-DAgger, while being applicable in the state-only setting and not requiring online experts. To our knowledge, our approach is the first efficient method for Meta-IRL that scales to the function approximator setting.

Stabilizing Transformer Training by Preventing Attention Entropy Collapse,"Training stability is of great importance to Transformers. In this work, we investigate the training dynamics of Transformers by examining the evolution of the attention layers. In particular, we track the attention entropy for each attention head during the course of training, which is a proxy for model sharpness. We identify a common pattern across different architectures and tasks, where low attention entropy is accompanied by high training instability, which can take the form of oscillating loss or divergence. We denote the pathologically low attention entropy, corresponding to highly concentrated attention scores, as $\textit{entropy collapse}$. As a remedy, we propose $\sigma$Reparam, a simple and efficient solution where we reparametrize all linear layers with spectral normalization and an additional learned scalar. We demonstrate that $\sigma$Reparam successfully prevents entropy collapse in the attention layers, promoting more stable training. Additionally, we prove a tight lower bound of the attention entropy, which decreases exponentially fast with the spectral norm of the attention logits, providing additional motivation for our approach. We conduct experiments with $\sigma$Reparam on image classification, image self-supervised learning, machine translation, speech recognition, and language modeling tasks. We show that $\sigma$Reparam provides stability and robustness with respect to the choice of hyperparameters, going so far as enabling training (a) a Vision Transformer {to competitive performance} without warmup, weight decay, layer normalization or adaptive optimizers; (b) deep architectures in machine translation and (c) speech recognition to competitive performance without warmup and adaptive optimizers.

Lower Bounds on Cross-Entropy Loss in the Presence of Test-time Adversaries,"Understanding the fundamental limits of robust supervised learning has emerged as a problem of immense interest, from both practical and theoretical standpoints. In particular, it is critical to determine classifier-agnostic bounds on the training loss to establish when learning is possible. In this paper, we determine optimal lower bounds on the cross-entropy loss in the presence of test-time adversaries, along with the corresponding optimal classification outputs. Our formulation of the bound as a solution to an optimization problem is general enough to encompass any loss function depending on soft classifier outputs. We also propose and provide a proof of correctness for a bespoke algorithm to compute this lower bound efficiently, allowing us to determine lower bounds for multiple practical datasets of interest. We use our lower bounds as a diagnostic tool to determine the effectiveness of current robust training methods and find a gap from optimality at larger budgets. Finally, we investigate the possibility of using of optimal classification outputs as soft labels to empirically improve robust training.",52,2,0,4,4,44.0,8224.0,19.0,0
Telescoping Density-Ratio Estimation,"Density-ratio estimation via classification is a cornerstone of unsupervised learning. It has provided the foundation for state-of-the-art methods in representation learning and generative modelling, with the number of use-cases continuing to proliferate. However, it suffers from a critical limitation: it fails to accurately estimate ratios p/q for which the two densities differ significantly. Empirically, we find this occurs whenever the KL divergence between p and q exceeds tens of nats. To resolve this limitation, we introduce a new framework, telescoping density-ratio estimation (TRE), that enables the estimation of ratios between highly dissimilar densities in high-dimensional spaces. Our experiments demonstrate that TRE can yield substantial improvements over existing single-ratio methods for mutual information estimation, representation learning and energy-based modelling.",81,87,14,5,3,5.0,122.0,5.0,0
"PlasticityNet: Learning to Simulate Metal, Sand, and Snow for Optimization Time Integration","In this paper, we propose a neural network-based approach for learning to represent the behavior of plastic solid materials ranging from rubber and metal to sand and snow. Unlike elastic forces such as spring forces, these plastic forces do not result from the positional gradient of any potential energy, imposing great challenges on the stability and flexibility of their simulation. Our method effectively resolves this issue by learning a generalizable plastic energy whose derivative closely matches the analytical behavior of plastic forces. Our method, for the first time, enables the simulation of a wide range of arbitrary elasticity-plasticity combinations using time step-independent, unconditionally stable optimization-based time integrators. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by learning and producing challenging 2D and 3D effects of metal, sand, and snow with complex dynamics.",63,11,0,0,6,24.0,353.0,10.0,0
DoCoFL: Downlink Compression for Cross-Device Federated Learning,"Many compression techniques have been proposed to reduce the communication overhead of Federated Learning training procedures. However, these are typically designed for compressing model updates, which are expected to decay throughout training. As a result, such methods are inapplicable to downlink (i.e., from the parameter server to clients) compression in the cross-device setting, where heterogeneous clients $\textit{may appear only once}$ during training and thus must download the model parameters. Accordingly, we propose $\textsf{DoCoFL}$ -- a new framework for downlink compression in the cross-device setting. Importantly, $\textsf{DoCoFL}$ can be seamlessly combined with many uplink compression schemes, rendering it suitable for bi-directional compression. Through extensive evaluation, we show that $\textsf{DoCoFL}$ offers significant bi-directional bandwidth reduction while achieving competitive accuracy to that of a baseline without any compression.",66,14,0,2,4,6.0,149.0,5.0,0
Λ-DARTS: Mitigating Performance Collapse by Harmonizing Operation Selection among Cells,"Differentiable neural architecture search (DARTS) is a popular method for neural architecture search (NAS), which performs cell-search and utilizes continuous relaxation to improve the search efficiency via gradient-based optimization. The main shortcoming of DARTS is performance collapse, where the discovered architecture suffers from a pattern of declining quality during search. Performance collapse has become an important topic of research, with many methods trying to solve the issue through either regularization or fundamental changes to DARTS. However, the weight-sharing framework used for cell-search in DARTS and the convergence of architecture parameters has not been analyzed yet. In this paper, we provide a thorough and novel theoretical and empirical analysis on DARTS and its point of convergence. We show that DARTS suffers from a specific structural flaw due to its weight-sharing framework that limits the convergence of DARTS to saturation points of the softmax function. This point of convergence gives an unfair advantage to layers closer to the output in choosing the optimal architecture, causing performance collapse. We then propose two new regularization terms that aim to prevent performance collapse by harmonizing operation selection via aligning gradients of layers. Experimental results on six different search spaces and three different datasets show that our method ($\Lambda$-DARTS) does indeed prevent performance collapse, providing justification for our theoretical analysis and the proposed remedy.",40,13,2,3,7,10.0,97.0,5.0,0
Accelerating Gossip SGD with Periodic Global Averaging,"Communication overhead hinders the scalability of large-scale distributed training. Gossip SGD, where each node averages only with its neighbors, is more communication-efficient than the prevalent parallel SGD. However, its convergence rate is reversely proportional to quantity $1-\beta$ which measures the network connectivity. On large and sparse networks where $1-\beta \to 0$, Gossip SGD requires more iterations to converge, which offsets against its communication benefit. This paper introduces Gossip-PGA, which adds Periodic Global Averaging into Gossip SGD. Its transient stage, i.e., the iterations required to reach asymptotic linear speedup stage, improves from $\Omega(\beta^4 n^3/(1-\beta)^4)$ to $\Omega(\beta^4 n^3 H^4)$ for non-convex problems. The influence of network topology in Gossip-PGA can be controlled by the averaging period $H$. Its transient-stage complexity is also superior to Local SGD which has order $\Omega(n^3 H^4)$. Empirical results of large-scale training on image classification (ResNet50) and language modeling (BERT) validate our theoretical findings.",57,41,7,4,6,21.0,546.0,12.0,0
Continuous-time edge modelling using non-parametric point processes,"The mutually-exciting Hawkes process (ME-HP) is a natural choice to model reciprocity , which is an important attribute of continuous-time edge (dyadic) data. However, existing ways of implementing the ME-HP for such data are either inflexible, as the exogenous (background) rate functions are typically constant and the endogenous (excitation) rate functions are specified parametrically, or inefficient, as inference usually relies on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods with high computational costs. To address these limitations, we discuss various approaches to model design, and develop three variants of non-parametric point processes for continuous-time edge modelling (CTEM). The resulting models are highly adaptable as they generate intensity functions through sigmoidal Gaussian processes, and so provide greater modelling flexibility than parametric forms. The models are implemented via a fast variational inference method enabled by a novel edge modelling construction. The superior performance of the proposed CTEM models is demonstrated through extensive experimental evaluations on four real-world continuous-time edge data sets.",43,5,1,0,4,43.0,288.0,11.0,0
Latent Space Energy-Based Model of Symbol-Vector Coupling for Text Generation and Classification,"We propose a latent space energy-based prior model for text generation and classification. The model stands on a generator network that generates the text sequence based on a continuous latent vector. The energy term of the prior model couples a continuous latent vector and a symbolic one-hot vector, so that discrete category can be inferred from the observed example based on the continuous latent vector. Such a latent space coupling naturally enables incorporation of information bottleneck regularization to encourage the continuous latent vector to extract information from the observed example that is informative of the underlying category. In our learning method, the symbol-vector coupling, the generator network and the inference network are learned jointly. Our model can be learned in an unsupervised setting where no category labels are provided. It can also be learned in semi-supervised setting where category labels are provided for a subset of training examples. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model learns well-structured and meaningful latent space, which (1) guides the generator to generate text with high quality, diversity, and interpretability, and (2) effectively classifies text.",49,17,2,4,2,26.0,1893.0,14.0,0
Reducing SO(3) Convolutions to SO(2) for Efficient Equivariant GNNs,"Graph neural networks that model 3D data, such as point clouds or atoms, are typically desired to be $SO(3)$ equivariant, i.e., equivariant to 3D rotations. Unfortunately equivariant convolutions, which are a fundamental operation for equivariant networks, increase significantly in computational complexity as higher-order tensors are used. In this paper, we address this issue by reducing the $SO(3)$ convolutions or tensor products to mathematically equivalent convolutions in $SO(2)$ . This is accomplished by aligning the node embeddings' primary axis with the edge vectors, which sparsifies the tensor product and reduces the computational complexity from $O(L^6)$ to $O(L^3)$, where $L$ is the degree of the representation. We demonstrate the potential implications of this improvement by proposing the Equivariant Spherical Channel Network (eSCN), a graph neural network utilizing our novel approach to equivariant convolutions, which achieves state-of-the-art results on the large-scale OC-20 and OC-22 datasets.",58,65,9,2,2,3.0,243.0,2.0,1
Expert-based reward function training: the novel method to train sequence generators,"The training methods of sequence generator with a combination of GAN and policy gradient has shown good performance. In this paper, we propose expert-based reward function training: the novel method to train sequence generator. Different from previous studies of sequence generation, expert-based reward function training does not utilize GAN’s framework. Still, our model outperforms SeqGAN and a strong baseline, RankGAN.",8,0,0,7,4,4.0,17.0,2.0,0
Learning Multi-resolution Functional Maps with Spectral Attention for Robust Shape Matching,"In this work, we present a novel non-rigid shape matching framework based on multi-resolution functional maps with spectral attention. Existing functional map learning methods all rely on the critical choice of the spectral resolution hyperparameter, which can severely affect the overall accuracy or lead to overfitting, if not chosen carefully. In this paper, we show that spectral resolution tuning can be alleviated by introducing spectral attention. Our framework is applicable in both supervised and unsupervised settings, and we show that it is possible to train the network so that it can adapt the spectral resolution, depending on the given shape input. More specifically, we propose to compute multi-resolution functional maps that characterize correspondence across a range of spectral resolutions, and introduce a spectral attention network that helps to combine this representation into a single coherent final correspondence. Our approach is not only accurate with near-isometric input, for which a high spectral resolution is typically preferred, but also robust and able to produce reasonable matching even in the presence of significant non-isometric distortion, which poses great challenges to existing methods. We demonstrate the superior performance of our approach through experiments on a suite of challenging near-isometric and non-isometric shape matching benchmarks.",64,24,5,3,3,13.0,519.0,9.0,0
Most ReLU Networks Suffer from $\ell^2$ Adversarial Perturbations,"We consider ReLU networks with random weights, in which the dimension decreases at each layer. We show that for most such networks, most examples $x$ admit an adversarial perturbation at an Euclidean distance of $O\left(\frac{\|x\|}{\sqrt{d}}\right)$, where $d$ is the input dimension. Moreover, this perturbation can be found via gradient flow, as well as gradient descent with sufficiently small steps. This result can be seen as an explanation to the abundance of adversarial examples, and to the fact that they are found via gradient descent.",21,14,0,5,2,53.0,1671.0,21.0,0
Sparse Multi-Channel Variational Autoencoder for the Joint Analysis of Heterogeneous Data,"Interpretable modeling of heterogeneous data channels is essential in medical applications, for example when jointly analyzing clinical scores and medical images. Variational Autoencoders (VAE) are powerful generative models that learn representations of complex data. The flexibility of VAE may come at the expense of lack of interpretability in describing the joint relationship between heterogeneous data. To tackle this problem, in this work we extend the variational framework of VAE to bring parsimony and inter-pretability when jointly account for latent relationships across multiple channels. In the latent space, this is achieved by constraining the varia-tional distribution of each channel to a common target prior. Parsimonious latent representations are enforced by variational dropout. Experiments on synthetic data show that our model correctly identifies the prescribed latent dimensions and data relationships across multiple testing scenarios. When applied to imaging and clinical data, our method allows to identify the joint effect of age and pathology in describing clinical condition in a large scale clinical cohort.",33,44,5,6,4,17.0,362.0,8.0,0
On the Inherent Regularization Effects of Noise Injection During Training,"Randomly perturbing networks during the training process is a commonly used approach to improving generalization performance. In this paper, we present a theoretical study of one particular way of random perturbation, which corresponds to injecting artificial noise to the training data. We provide a precise asymptotic characterization of the training and generalization errors of such randomly perturbed learning problems on a random feature model. Our analysis shows that Gaussian noise injection in the training process is equivalent to introducing a weighted ridge regularization, when the number of noise injections tends to infinity. The explicit form of the regularization is also given. Numerical results corroborate our asymptotic predictions, showing that they are accurate even in moderate problem dimensions. Our theoretical predictions are based on a new correlated Gaussian equivalence conjecture that generalizes recent results in the study of random feature models.",43,24,2,4,2,15.0,326.0,9.0,0
On the Convergence to a Global Solution of Shuffling-Type Gradient Algorithms,"Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm is the method of choice in many machine learning tasks thanks to its scalability and efficiency in dealing with large-scale problems. In this paper, we focus on the shuffling version of SGD which matches the mainstream practical heuristics. We show the convergence to a global solution of shuffling SGD for a class of non-convex functions under over-parameterized settings. Our analysis employs more relaxed non-convex assumptions than previous literature. Nevertheless, we maintain the desired computational complexity as shuffling SGD has achieved in the general convex setting.",65,3,0,3,2,64.0,1872.0,21.0,0
A Fast and Scalable Joint Estimator for Integrating Additional Knowledge in Learning Multiple Related Sparse Gaussian Graphical Models,"We consider the problem of including additional knowledge in estimating sparse Gaussian graphical models (sGGMs) from aggregated samples, arising often in bioinformatics and neuroimaging applications. Previous joint sGGM estimators either fail to use existing knowledge or cannot scale-up to many tasks (large $K$) under a high-dimensional (large $p$) situation. In this paper, we propose a novel \underline{J}oint \underline{E}lementary \underline{E}stimator incorporating additional \underline{K}nowledge (JEEK) to infer multiple related sparse Gaussian Graphical models from large-scale heterogeneous data. Using domain knowledge as weights, we design a novel hybrid norm as the minimization objective to enforce the superposition of two weighted sparsity constraints, one on the shared interactions and the other on the task-specific structural patterns. This enables JEEK to elegantly consider various forms of existing knowledge based on the domain at hand and avoid the need to design knowledge-specific optimization. JEEK is solved through a fast and entry-wise parallelizable solution that largely improves the computational efficiency of the state-of-the-art $O(p^5K^4)$ to $O(p^2K^4)$. We conduct a rigorous statistical analysis showing that JEEK achieves the same convergence rate $O(\log(Kp)/n_{tot})$ as the state-of-the-art estimators that are much harder to compute. Empirically, on multiple synthetic datasets and two real-world data, JEEK outperforms the speed of the state-of-arts significantly while achieving the same level of prediction accuracy.

Prospect Pruning: Finding Trainable Weights at Initialization using Meta-Gradients,"Pruning neural networks at initialization would enable us to find sparse models that retain the accuracy of the original network while consuming fewer computational resources for training and inference. However, current methods are insufficient to enable this optimization and lead to a large degradation in model performance. In this paper, we identify a fundamental limitation in the formulation of current methods, namely that their saliency criteria look at a single step at the start of training without taking into account the trainability of the network. While pruning iteratively and gradually has been shown to improve pruning performance, explicit consideration of the training stage that will immediately follow pruning has so far been absent from the computation of the saliency criterion. To overcome the short-sightedness of existing methods, we propose Prospect Pruning (ProsPr), which uses meta-gradients through the first few steps of optimization to determine which weights to prune. ProsPr combines an estimate of the higherorder effects of pruning on the loss and the optimization trajectory to identify the trainable sub-network. Our method achieves state-of-the-art pruning performance on a variety of vision classification tasks, with less data and in a single shot compared to existing pruning-at-initialization methods.

CATS: Enhancing Multivariate Time Series Forecasting by Constructing Auxiliary Time Series as Exogenous Variables,"For Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF), recent deep learning applications show that univariate models frequently outperform multivariate ones. To address the difficiency in multivariate models, we introduce a method to Construct Auxiliary Time Series (CATS) that functions like a 2D temporal-contextual attention mechanism, which generates Auxiliary Time Series (ATS) from Original Time Series (OTS) to effectively represent and incorporate inter-series relationships for forecasting. Key principles of ATS - continuity, sparsity, and variability - are identified and implemented through different modules. Even with a basic 2-layer MLP as core predictor, CATS achieves state-of-the-art, significantly reducing complexity and parameters compared to previous multivariate models, marking it an efficient and transferable MTSF solution.",31,13,1,1,4,4.0,18.0,2.0,1
Fast Imitation via Behavior Foundation Models,"Imitation learning (IL) aims at producing agents that can imitate any behavior given a few expert demonstrations.

Approximation and Estimation Ability of Transformers for Sequence-to-Sequence Functions with Infinite Dimensional Input,"Despite the great success of Transformer networks in various applications such as natural language processing and computer vision, their theoretical aspects are not well understood. In this paper, we study the approximation and estimation ability of Transformers as sequence-to-sequence functions with infinite dimensional inputs. Although inputs and outputs are both infinite dimensional, we show that when the target function has anisotropic smoothness, Transformers can avoid the curse of dimensionality due to their feature extraction ability and parameter sharing property. In addition, we show that even if the smoothness changes depending on each input, Transformers can estimate the importance of features for each input and extract important features dynamically. Then, we proved that Transformers achieve similar convergence rate as in the case of the fixed smoothness. Our theoretical results support the practical success of Transformers for high dimensional data.",34,13,2,2,2,3.0,19.0,3.0,0
GAN-based Generation and Automatic Selection of Explanations for Neural Networks,"One way to interpret trained deep neural networks (DNNs) is by inspecting characteristics that neurons in the model respond to, such as by iteratively optimising the model input (e.g., an image) to maximally activate specific neurons. However, this requires a careful selection of hyper-parameters to generate interpretable examples for each neuron of interest, and current methods rely on a manual, qualitative evaluation of each setting, which is prohibitively slow. We introduce a new metric that uses Frechet Inception Distance (FID) to encourage similarity between model activations for real and generated data. This provides an efficient way to evaluate a set of generated examples for each setting of hyper-parameters. We also propose a novel GAN-based method for generating explanations that enables an efficient search through the input space and imposes a strong prior favouring realistic outputs. We apply our approach to a classification model trained to predict whether a music audio recording contains singing voice. Our results suggest that this proposed metric successfully selects hyper-parameters leading to interpretable examples, avoiding the need for manual evaluation. Moreover, we see that examples synthesised to maximise or minimise the predicted probability of singing voice presence exhibit vocal or non-vocal characteristics, respectively, suggesting that our approach is able to generate suitable explanations for understanding concepts learned by a neural network.",0,9,1,6,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0
The Minority Matters: A Diversity-Promoting Collaborative Metric Learning Algorithm,"Collaborative Metric Learning (CML) has recently emerged as a popular method in recommendation systems (RS), closing the gap between metric learning and Collaborative Filtering. Following the convention of RS, existing methods exploit unique user representation in their model design. This paper focuses on a challenging scenario where a user has multiple categories of interests. Under this setting, we argue that the unique user representation might induce preference bias, especially when the item category distribution is imbalanced. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called \textit{Diversity-Promoting Collaborative Metric Learning} (DPCML), with the hope of considering the commonly ignored minority interest of the user. The key idea behind DPCML is to include a multiple set of representations for each user in the system. Based on this embedding paradigm, user preference toward an item is aggregated from different embeddings by taking the minimum item-user distance among the user embedding set. Furthermore, we observe that the diversity of the embeddings for the same user also plays an essential role in the model. To this end, we propose a \textit{diversity control regularization} term to accommodate the multi-vector representation strategy better. Theoretically, we show that DPCML could generalize well to unseen test data by tackling the challenge of the annoying operation that comes from the minimum value. Experiments over a range of benchmark datasets speak to the efficacy of DPCML.",66,7,0,3,6,18.0,181.0,7.0,0
When Demonstrations meet Generative World Models: A Maximum Likelihood Framework for Offline Inverse Reinforcement Learning,"Offline inverse reinforcement learning (Offline IRL) aims to recover the structure of rewards and environment dynamics that underlie observed actions in a fixed, finite set of demonstrations from an expert agent. Accurate models of expertise in executing a task has applications in safety-sensitive applications such as clinical decision making and autonomous driving. However, the structure of an expert's preferences implicit in observed actions is closely linked to the expert's model of the environment dynamics (i.e. the ``world'' model). Thus, inaccurate models of the world obtained from finite data with limited coverage could compound inaccuracy in estimated rewards. To address this issue, we propose a bi-level optimization formulation of the estimation task wherein the upper level is likelihood maximization based upon a conservative model of the expert's policy (lower level). The policy model is conservative in that it maximizes reward subject to a penalty that is increasing in the uncertainty of the estimated model of the world. We propose a new algorithmic framework to solve the bi-level optimization problem formulation and provide statistical and computational guarantees of performance for the associated optimal reward estimator. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art offline IRL and imitation learning benchmarks by a large margin, over the continuous control tasks in MuJoCo and different datasets in the D4RL benchmark.",71,8,1,2,4,15.0,258.0,8.0,0
Conditional Temporal Neural Processes with Covariance Loss,"We introduce a novel loss function, Covariance Loss , which is conceptually equivalent to conditional neural processes and has a form of regularization so that is applicable to many kinds of neural networks. With the proposed loss, mappings from input variables to target variables are highly affected by dependencies of target variables as well as mean activation and mean dependencies of input and target variables. This nature enables the resulting neural networks to become more robust to noisy observations and recapture missing dependencies from prior information. In order to show the validity of the proposed loss, we conduct extensive sets of experiments on real-world datasets with state-of-the-art models and discuss the beneﬁts and drawbacks of the proposed Co-variance Loss.",29,15,0,0,6,4.0,18.0,2.0,0
BLIP: Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training for Unified Vision-Language Understanding and Generation,"Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) has advanced the performance for many vision-language tasks. However, most existing pre-trained models only excel in either understanding-based tasks or generation-based tasks. Furthermore, performance improvement has been largely achieved by scaling up the dataset with noisy image-text pairs collected from the web, which is a suboptimal source of supervision. In this paper, we propose BLIP, a new VLP framework which transfers flexibly to both vision-language understanding and generation tasks. BLIP effectively utilizes the noisy web data by bootstrapping the captions, where a captioner generates synthetic captions and a filter removes the noisy ones. We achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of vision-language tasks, such as image-text retrieval (+2.7% in average recall@1), image captioning (+2.8% in CIDEr), and VQA (+1.6% in VQA score). BLIP also demonstrates strong generalization ability when directly transferred to video-language tasks in a zero-shot manner.

Model-Free Opponent Shaping,"In general-sum games, the interaction of self-interested learning agents commonly leads to collectively worst-case outcomes, such as defect-defect in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD). To overcome this, some methods, such as Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA), shape their opponents' learning process. However, these methods are myopic since only a small number of steps can be anticipated, are asymmetric since they treat other agents as naive learners, and require the use of higher-order derivatives, which are calculated through white-box access to an opponent's differentiable learning algorithm. To address these issues, we propose Model-Free Opponent Shaping (M-FOS). M-FOS learns in a meta-game in which each meta-step is an episode of the underlying inner game. The meta-state consists of the inner policies, and the meta-policy produces a new inner policy to be used in the next episode. M-FOS then uses generic model-free optimisation methods to learn meta-policies that accomplish long-horizon opponent shaping. Empirically, M-FOS near-optimally exploits naive learners and other, more sophisticated algorithms from the literature. For example, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first method to learn the well-known Zero-Determinant (ZD) extortion strategy in the IPD. In the same settings, M-FOS leads to socially optimal outcomes under meta-self-play. Finally, we show that M-FOS can be scaled to high-dimensional settings.",37,37,7,3,4,12.0,290.0,8.0,0

Robust Classification via a Single Diffusion Model,"Diffusion models have been applied to improve adversarial robustness of image classifiers by purifying the adversarial noises or generating realistic data for adversarial training. However, diffusion-based purification can be evaded by stronger adaptive attacks while adversarial training does not perform well under unseen threats, exhibiting inevitable limitations of these methods. To better harness the expressive power of diffusion models, this paper proposes Robust Diffusion Classifier (RDC), a generative classifier that is constructed from a pre-trained diffusion model to be adversarially robust. RDC first maximizes the data likelihood of a given input and then predicts the class probabilities of the optimized input using the conditional likelihood estimated by the diffusion model through Bayes' theorem. To further reduce the computational cost, we propose a new diffusion backbone called multi-head diffusion and develop efficient sampling strategies. As RDC does not require training on particular adversarial attacks, we demonstrate that it is more generalizable to defend against multiple unseen threats. In particular, RDC achieves $75.67\%$ robust accuracy against various $\ell_\infty$ norm-bounded adaptive attacks with $\epsilon_\infty=8/255$ on CIFAR-10, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art adversarial training models by $+4.77\%$. The results highlight the potential of generative classifiers by employing pre-trained diffusion models for adversarial robustness compared with the commonly studied discriminative classifiers.

Towards Reliable Simulation-Based Inference with Balanced Neural Ratio Estimation,"Modern approaches for simulation-based inference rely upon deep learning surrogates to enable approximate inference with computer simulators. In practice, the estimated posteriors' computational faithfulness is, however, rarely guaranteed. For example, Hermans et al. (2021) show that current simulation-based inference algorithms can produce posteriors that are overconfident, hence risking false inferences. In this work, we introduce Balanced Neural Ratio Estimation (BNRE), a variation of the NRE algorithm designed to produce posterior approximations that tend to be more conservative, hence improving their reliability, while sharing the same Bayes optimal solution. We achieve this by enforcing a balancing condition that increases the quantified uncertainty in small simulation budget regimes while still converging to the exact posterior as the budget increases. We provide theoretical arguments showing that BNRE tends to produce posterior surrogates that are more conservative than NRE's. We evaluate BNRE on a wide variety of tasks and show that it produces conservative posterior surrogates on all tested benchmarks and simulation budgets. Finally, we emphasize that BNRE is straightforward to implement over NRE and does not introduce any computational overhead.",38,25,2,3,5,8.0,124.0,6.0,0
GEOMetrics: Exploiting Geometric Structure for Graph-Encoded Objects,"Mesh models are a promising approach for encoding the structure of 3D objects. Current mesh reconstruction systems predict uniformly distributed vertex locations of a predetermined graph through a series of graph convolutions, leading to compromises with respect to performance or resolution. In this paper, we argue that the graph representation of geometric objects allows for additional structure, which should be leveraged for enhanced reconstruction. Thus, we propose a system which properly benefits from the advantages of the geometric structure of graph encoded objects by introducing (1) a graph convolutional update preserving vertex information; (2) an adaptive splitting heuristic allowing detail to emerge; and (3) a training objective operating both on the local surfaces defined by vertices as well as the global structure defined by the mesh. Our proposed method is evaluated on the task of 3D object reconstruction from images with the ShapeNet dataset, where we demonstrate state of the art performance, both visually and numerically, while having far smaller space requirements by generating adaptive meshes",61,89,9,6,4,11.0,1018.0,9.0,0
Adversarial Attacks on Linear Contextual Bandits,"Contextual bandit algorithms are applied in a wide range of domains, from advertising to recommender systems, from clinical trials to education. In many of these domains, malicious agents may have incentives to attack the bandit algorithm to induce it to perform a desired behavior. For instance, an unscrupulous ad publisher may try to increase their own revenue at the expense of the advertisers; a seller may want to increase the exposure of their products, or thwart a competitor's advertising campaign. In this paper, we study several attack scenarios and show that a malicious agent can force a linear contextual bandit algorithm to pull any desired arm $T - o(T)$ times over a horizon of $T$ steps, while applying adversarial modifications to either rewards or contexts that only grow logarithmically as $O(\log T)$. We also investigate the case when a malicious agent is interested in affecting the behavior of the bandit algorithm in a single context (e.g., a specific user). We first provide sufficient conditions for the feasibility of the attack and we then propose an efficient algorithm to perform the attack. We validate our theoretical results on experiments performed on both synthetic and real-world datasets.",40,48,6,5,7,18.0,251.0,10.0,0
On Perceptual Lossy Compression: The Cost of Perceptual Reconstruction and An Optimal Training Framework,"Lossy compression algorithms are typically designed to achieve the lowest possible distortion at a given bit rate. However, recent studies show that pursuing high perceptual quality would lead to increase of the lowest achievable distortion (e.g., MSE). This paper provides nontrivial results theoretically revealing that, \textit{1}) the cost of achieving perfect perception quality is exactly a doubling of the lowest achievable MSE distortion, \textit{2}) an optimal encoder for the""classic""rate-distortion problem is also optimal for the perceptual compression problem, \textit{3}) distortion loss is unnecessary for training a perceptual decoder. Further, we propose a novel training framework to achieve the lowest MSE distortion under perfect perception constraint at a given bit rate. This framework uses a GAN with discriminator conditioned on an MSE-optimized encoder, which is superior over the traditional framework using distortion plus adversarial loss. Experiments are provided to verify the theoretical finding and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed training framework.",50,31,2,4,5,10.0,88.0,4.0,0
Dynamic Knapsack Optimization Towards Efficient Multi-Channel Sequential Advertising,"In E-commerce, advertising is essential for merchants to reach their target users. The typical objective is to maximize the advertiser's cumulative revenue over a period of time under a budget constraint. In real applications, an advertisement (ad) usually needs to be exposed to the same user multiple times until the user finally contributes revenue (e.g., places an order). However, existing advertising systems mainly focus on the immediate revenue with single ad exposures, ignoring the contribution of each exposure to the final conversion, thus usually falls into suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we formulate the sequential advertising strategy optimization as a dynamic knapsack problem. We propose a theoretically guaranteed bilevel optimization framework, which significantly reduces the solution space of the original optimization space while ensuring the solution quality. To improve the exploration efficiency of reinforcement learning, we also devise an effective action space reduction approach. Extensive offline and online experiments show the superior performance of our approaches over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of cumulative revenue.",32,23,1,5,15,25.0,387.0,11.0,0
The Gambler's Problem and Beyond,"We analyze the Gambler's problem, a simple reinforcement learning problem where the gambler has the chance to double or lose their bets until the target is reached. This is an early example introduced in the reinforcement learning textbook by \cite{sutton2018reinforcement}, where they mention an interesting pattern of the optimal value function with high-frequency components and repeating non-smooth points but without further investigation. We provide the exact formula for the optimal value function for both the discrete and the continuous case. Though simple as it might seem, the value function is pathological: fractal, self-similar, non-smooth on any interval, zero derivative almost everywhere, and not written as elementary functions. Sharing these properties with the Cantor function, it holds a complexity that has been uncharted thus far. With the analysis, our work could lead insights on improving value function approximation, Q-learning, and gradient-based algorithms in real applications and implementations.",33,0,0,6,4,134.0,2979.0,29.0,0
Composed Fine-Tuning: Freezing Pre-Trained Denoising Autoencoders for Improved Generalization,"We focus on prediction problems with structured outputs that are subject to output validity constraints, e.g. pseudocode-to-code translation where the code must compile. While labeled input-output pairs are expensive to obtain,""unlabeled""outputs, i.e. outputs without corresponding inputs, are freely available (e.g. code on GitHub) and provide information about output validity. We can capture the output structure by pre-training a denoiser to denoise corrupted versions of unlabeled outputs. We first show that standard fine-tuning after pre-training destroys some of this structure. We then propose composed fine-tuning, which fine-tunes a predictor composed with the pre-trained denoiser, which is frozen to preserve output structure. For two-layer ReLU networks, we prove that composed fine-tuning significantly reduces the complexity of the predictor, thus improving generalization. Empirically, we show that composed fine-tuning improves over standard fine-tuning on two pseudocode-to-code translation datasets (3% and 6% relative). The improvement from composed fine-tuning is magnified on out-of-distribution (OOD) examples (4% and 25% relative).",81,12,0,5,3,22.0,8163.0,17.0,0
Implicit Regularization in Over-Parameterized Support Vector Machine,"In this paper, we design a regularization-free algorithm for high-dimensional support vector machines (SVMs) by integrating over-parameterization with Nesterov's smoothing method, and provide theoretical guarantees for the induced implicit regularization phenomenon. In particular, we construct an over-parameterized hinge loss function and estimate the true parameters by leveraging regularization-free gradient descent on this loss function. The utilization of Nesterov's method enhances the computational efficiency of our algorithm, especially in terms of determining the stopping criterion and reducing computational complexity. With appropriate choices of initialization, step size, and smoothness parameter, we demonstrate that unregularized gradient descent achieves a near-oracle statistical convergence rate. Additionally, we verify our theoretical findings through a variety of numerical experiments and compare the proposed method with explicit regularization. Our results illustrate the advantages of employing implicit regularization via gradient descent in conjunction with over-parameterization in sparse SVMs.",47,0,0,2,3,2.0,0.0,0.0,0
Diversity-Sensitive Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks,"We propose a simple yet highly effective method that addresses the mode-collapse problem in the Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN). Although conditional distributions are multi-modal (i.e., having many modes) in practice, most cGAN approaches tend to learn an overly simplified distribution where an input is always mapped to a single output regardless of variations in latent code. To address such issue, we propose to explicitly regularize the generator to produce diverse outputs depending on latent codes. The proposed regularization is simple, general, and can be easily integrated into most conditional GAN objectives. Additionally, explicit regularization on generator allows our method to control a balance between visual quality and diversity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three conditional generation tasks: image-to-image translation, image inpainting, and future video prediction. We show that simple addition of our regularization to existing models leads to surprisingly diverse generations, substantially outperforming the previous approaches for multi-modal conditional generation specifically designed in each individual task.",42,206,22,6,5,8.0,649.0,5.0,1
Explaining the Uncertain: Stochastic Shapley Values for Gaussian Process Models,"We present a novel approach for explaining Gaussian processes (GPs) that can utilize the full analytical covariance structure present in GPs. Our method is based on the popular solution concept of Shapley values extended to stochastic cooperative games, resulting in explanations that are random variables. The GP explanations generated using our approach satisfy similar favorable axioms to standard Shapley values and possess a tractable covariance function across features and data observations. This covariance allows for quantifying explanation uncertainties and studying the statistical dependencies between explanations. We further extend our framework to the problem of predictive explanation, and propose a Shapley prior over the explanation function to predict Shapley values for new data based on previously computed ones. Our extensive illustrations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",53,5,0,2,3,15.0,110.0,6.0,0
"LLC: Accurate, Multi-purpose Learnt Low-dimensional Binary Codes","Learning binary representations of instances and classes is a classical problem with several high potential applications. In modern settings, the compression of high-dimensional neural representations to low-dimensional binary codes is a challenging task and often require large bit-codes to be accurate. In this work, we propose a novel method for Learning Low-dimensional binary Codes (LLC) for instances as well as classes. Our method does not require any side-information, like annotated attributes or label meta-data, and learns extremely low-dimensional binary codes (~20 bits for ImageNet-1K). The learnt codes are super-efficient while still ensuring nearly optimal classification accuracy for ResNet50 on ImageNet-1K. We demonstrate that the learnt codes capture intrinsically important features in the data, by discovering an intuitive taxonomy over classes. We further quantitatively measure the quality of our codes by applying it to the efficient image retrieval as well as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problems. For ImageNet-100 retrieval problem, our learnt binary codes outperform 16 bit HashNet using only 10 bits and also are as accurate as 10 dimensional real representations. Finally, our learnt binary codes can perform OOD detection, out-of-the-box, as accurately as a baseline that needs ~3000 samples to tune its threshold, while we require none.

Provable Domain Generalization via Invariant-Feature Subspace Recovery,"Domain generalization asks for models trained over a set of training environments to perform well in unseen test environments. Recently, a series of algorithms such as Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) has been proposed for domain generalization. However, Rosenfeld et al. (2021) shows that in a simple linear data model, even if non-convexity issues are ignored, IRM and its extensions cannot generalize to unseen environments with less than $d_s+1$ training environments, where $d_s$ is the dimension of the spurious-feature subspace. In this paper, we propose to achieve domain generalization with Invariant-feature Subspace Recovery (ISR). Our first algorithm, ISR-Mean, can identify the subspace spanned by invariant features from the first-order moments of the class-conditional distributions, and achieve provable domain generalization with $d_s+1$ training environments under the data model of Rosenfeld et al. (2021). Our second algorithm, ISR-Cov, further reduces the required number of training environments to $O(1)$ using the information of second-order moments. Notably, unlike IRM, our algorithms bypass non-convexity issues and enjoy global convergence guarantees. Empirically, our ISRs can obtain superior performance compared with IRM on synthetic benchmarks. In addition, on three real-world image and text datasets, we show that both ISRs can be used as simple yet effective post-processing methods to improve the worst-case accuracy of (pre-)trained models against spurious correlations and group shifts.",80,29,3,3,4,14.0,224.0,8.0,0
Purifying Quantization-conditioned Backdoors via Layer-wise Activation Correction with Distribution Approximation,"Model quantization is a compression technique that converts a full-precision model to a more compact low-precision version for better storage. Despite the great success of quantization, recent studies revealed the feasibility of malicious exploiting model quantization via implanting quantization-conditioned backdoors (QCBs). These special backdoors remain dormant in full-precision models but are exposed upon quantization. Unfortunately, existing defenses have limited effects on mitigating QCBs. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of QCBs. We reveal an intriguing characteristic of QCBs, where activation of backdoor-related neurons on even benign samples enjoy a distribution drift after quantization, although this drift is more significant on poisoned samples. Motivated by this finding, we propose to purify the backdoor-exposed quantized model by aligning its layer-wise activation with its full-precision version. To further exploit the more pronounced activation drifts on poisoned samples, we design an additional module to layer-wisely approximate poisoned activation distribution based on batch normalization statistics of the full-precision model. Extensive experiments are conducted, verifying the effectiveness of our defense. Our code is publicly available here.",73,4,1,0,7,3.0,55.0,3.0,0
GBHT: Gradient Boosting Histogram Transform for Density Estimation,"In this paper, we propose a density estimation algorithm called \textit{Gradient Boosting Histogram Transform} (GBHT), where we adopt the \textit{Negative Log Likelihood} as the loss function to make the boosting procedure available for the unsupervised tasks. From a learning theory viewpoint, we first prove fast convergence rates for GBHT with the smoothness assumption that the underlying density function lies in the space $C^{0,\alpha}$. Then when the target density function lies in spaces $C^{1,\alpha}$, we present an upper bound for GBHT which is smaller than the lower bound of its corresponding base learner, in the sense of convergence rates. To the best of our knowledge, we make the first attempt to theoretically explain why boosting can enhance the performance of its base learners for density estimation problems. In experiments, we not only conduct performance comparisons with the widely used KDE, but also apply GBHT to anomaly detection to showcase a further application of GBHT.",39,8,0,4,4,9.0,130.0,4.0,0
How Should Pre-Trained Language Models Be Fine-Tuned Towards Adversarial Robustness?,"The fine-tuning of pre-trained language models has a great success in many NLP fields. Yet, it is strikingly vulnerable to adversarial examples, e.g., word substitution attacks using only synonyms can easily fool a BERT-based sentiment analysis model. In this paper, we demonstrate that adversarial training, the prevalent defense technique, does not directly fit a conventional fine-tuning scenario, because it suffers severely from catastrophic forgetting: failing to retain the generic and robust linguistic features that have already been captured by the pre-trained model. In this light, we propose Robust Informative Fine-Tuning (RIFT), a novel adversarial fine-tuning method from an information-theoretical perspective. In particular, RIFT encourages an objective model to retain the features learned from the pre-trained model throughout the entire fine-tuning process, whereas a conventional one only uses the pre-trained weights for initialization. Experimental results show that RIFT consistently outperforms the state-of-the-arts on two popular NLP tasks: sentiment analysis and natural language inference, under different attacks across various pre-trained language models.",85,50,2,4,5,3.0,148.0,3.0,0
Sparsifying Networks via Subdifferential Inclusion,"Sparsifying deep neural networks is of paramount interest in many areas, especially when those networks have to be implemented on low-memory devices. In this article, we propose a new formulation of the problem of generating sparse weights for a pre-trained neural network. By leveraging the properties of standard nonlinear activation functions, we show that the problem is equivalent to an approximate subdifferential inclusion problem. The accuracy of the approximation controls the sparsity. We show that the proposed approach is valid for a broad class of activation functions (ReLU, sigmoid, softmax). We propose an iterative optimization algorithm to induce sparsity whose convergence is guaranteed. Because of the algorithm ﬂexibility, the sparsity can be ensured from partial training data in a minibatch manner. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we perform experiments on various networks in different applicative contexts:",81,13,1,0,2,10.0,178.0,4.0,0
RANet: Region Attention Network for Semantic Segmentation,"Recent semantic segmentation methods model the relationship between pixels to construct the contextual representations. In this paper, we introduce the Region Attention Network (RANet), a novel attention network for modeling the relationship between object regions. RANet divides the image into object regions, where we select the representative information. In contrast to the previous methods, RANet configures the information pathways between the pixels in different regions, enabling the region interaction to exchange the regional context for enhancing all of the pixels in the image. We train the construction of object regions, the selection of the representative regional contents, the configuration of information pathways and the context exchange between pixels, jointly, to improve the segmentation accuracy. We extensively evaluate our method on the challenging segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating that RANet effectively helps to achieve the state-of-the-art results.

Representation Learning for Online and Offline RL in Low-rank MDPs,"This work studies the question of Representation Learning in RL: how can we learn a compact low-dimensional representation such that on top of the representation we can perform RL procedures such as exploration and exploitation, in a sample efficient manner. We focus on the low-rank Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) where the transition dynamics correspond to a low-rank transition matrix. Unlike prior works that assume the representation is known (e.g., linear MDPs), here we need to learn the representation for the low-rank MDP. We study both the online RL and offline RL settings. For the online setting, operating with the same computational oracles used in FLAMBE (Agarwal et.al), the state-of-art algorithm for learning representations in low-rank MDPs, we propose an algorithm REP-UCB Upper Confidence Bound driven Representation learning for RL), which significantly improves the sample complexity from $\widetilde{O}( A^9 d^7 / (\epsilon^{10} (1-\gamma)^{22}))$ for FLAMBE to $\widetilde{O}( A^2 d^4 / (\epsilon^2 (1-\gamma)^{5}) )$ with $d$ being the rank of the transition matrix (or dimension of the ground truth representation), $A$ being the number of actions, and $\gamma$ being the discounted factor. Notably, REP-UCB is simpler than FLAMBE, as it directly balances the interplay between representation learning, exploration, and exploitation, while FLAMBE is an explore-then-commit style approach and has to perform reward-free exploration step-by-step forward in time. For the offline RL setting, we develop an algorithm that leverages pessimism to learn under a partial coverage condition: our algorithm is able to compete against any policy as long as it is covered by the offline distribution.",63,117,25,4,3,51.0,1664.0,22.0,1
SequenceMatch: Imitation Learning for Autoregressive Sequence Modelling with Backtracking,"In many domains, autoregressive models can attain high likelihood on the task of predicting the next observation. However, this maximum-likelihood (MLE) objective does not necessarily match a downstream use-case of autoregressively generating high-quality sequences. The MLE objective weights sequences proportionally to their frequency under the data distribution, with no guidance for the model's behaviour out of distribution (OOD): leading to compounding error during autoregressive generation. In order to address this compounding error problem, we formulate sequence generation as an imitation learning (IL) problem. This allows us to minimize a variety of divergences between the distribution of sequences generated by an autoregressive model and sequences from a dataset, including divergences with weight on OOD generated sequences. The IL framework also allows us to incorporate backtracking by introducing a backspace action into the generation process. This further mitigates the compounding error problem by allowing the model to revert a sampled token if it takes the sequence OOD. Our resulting method, SequenceMatch, can be implemented without adversarial training or architectural changes. We identify the SequenceMatch-$\chi^2$ divergence as a more suitable training objective for autoregressive models which are used for generation. We show that empirically, SequenceMatch training leads to improvements over MLE on text generation with language models and arithmetic.",43,6,1,2,2,16.0,530.0,9.0,0
DIVA: Dataset Derivative of a Learning Task,"We present a method to compute the derivative of a learning task with respect to a dataset. A learning task is a function from a training set to the validation error, which can be represented by a trained deep neural network (DNN). The""dataset derivative""is a linear operator, computed around the trained model, that informs how perturbations of the weight of each training sample affect the validation error, usually computed on a separate validation dataset. Our method, DIVA (Differentiable Validation) hinges on a closed-form differentiable expression of the leave-one-out cross-validation error around a pre-trained DNN. Such expression constitutes the dataset derivative. DIVA could be used for dataset auto-curation, for example removing samples with faulty annotations, augmenting a dataset with additional relevant samples, or rebalancing. More generally, DIVA can be used to optimize the dataset, along with the parameters of the model, as part of the training process without the need for a separate validation dataset, unlike bi-level optimization methods customary in AutoML. To illustrate the flexibility of DIVA, we report experiments on sample auto-curation tasks such as outlier rejection, dataset extension, and automatic aggregation of multi-modal data.",75,5,0,4,6,13.0,124.0,6.0,0
Look Ahead or Look Around? A Theoretical Comparison Between Autoregressive and Masked Pretraining,"In recent years, the rise of generative self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms has exhibited impressive performance across visual, language, and multi-modal domains. While the varied designs of generative SSL objectives lead to distinct properties in downstream tasks, a theoretical understanding of these differences remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we establish the first theoretical comparisons between two leading generative SSL paradigms: autoregressive SSL and masked SSL. Through establishing theoretical frameworks, we elucidate the strengths and limitations of autoregressive and masked SSL within the primary evaluation tasks of classification and content generation. Our findings demonstrate that in classification tasks, the flexibility of targeted tokens in masked SSL fosters more inter-sample connections compared to the fixed position of target tokens in autoregressive SSL, which yields superior clustering performance. In content generation tasks, the misalignment between the flexible lengths of test samples and the fixed length of unmasked texts in masked SSL (vs. flexible lengths of conditional texts in autoregressive SSL) hinders its generation performance. To leverage each other's strengths and mitigate weaknesses, we propose diversity-enhanced autoregressive and variable-length masked objectives, which substantially improve the classification performance of autoregressive SSL and the generation performance of masked SSL.

Toward a realistic model of speech processing in the brain with self-supervised learning,"Several deep neural networks have recently been shown to generate activations similar to those of the brain in response to the same input. These algorithms, however, remain largely implausible: they require (1) extraordinarily large amounts of data, (2) unobtainable supervised labels, (3) textual rather than raw sensory input, and / or (4) implausibly large memory (e.g. thousands of contextual words). These elements highlight the need to identify algorithms that, under these limitations, would suffice to account for both behavioral and brain responses. Focusing on the issue of speech processing, we here hypothesize that self-supervised algorithms trained on the raw waveform constitute a promising candidate. Specifically, we compare a recent self-supervised architecture, Wav2Vec 2.0, to the brain activity of 412 English, French, and Mandarin individuals recorded with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), while they listened to ~1h of audio books. Our results are four-fold. First, we show that this algorithm learns brain-like representations with as little as 600 hours of unlabelled speech -- a quantity comparable to what infants can be exposed to during language acquisition. Second, its functional hierarchy aligns with the cortical hierarchy of speech processing. Third, different training regimes reveal a functional specialization akin to the cortex: Wav2Vec 2.0 learns sound-generic, speech-specific and language-specific representations similar to those of the prefrontal and temporal cortices. Fourth, we confirm the similarity of this specialization with the behavior of 386 additional participants. These elements, resulting from the largest neuroimaging benchmark to date, show how self-supervised learning can account for a rich organization of speech processing in the brain, and thus delineate a path to identify the laws of language acquisition which shape the human brain.",77,81,7,3,8,13.0,284.0,7.0,1
Towards Codable Watermarking for Injecting Multi-Bits Information to LLMs,"As large language models (LLMs) generate texts with increasing fluency and realism, there is a growing need to identify the source of texts to prevent the abuse of LLMs. Text watermarking techniques have proven reliable in distinguishing whether a text is generated by LLMs by injecting hidden patterns. However, we argue that existing LLM watermarking methods are encoding-inefficient and cannot flexibly meet the diverse information encoding needs (such as encoding model version, generation time, user id, etc.). In this work, we conduct the first systematic study on the topic of Codable Text Watermarking for LLMs (CTWL) that allows text watermarks to carry multi-bit customizable information. First of all, we study the taxonomy of LLM watermarking technologies and give a mathematical formulation for CTWL. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation system for CTWL: (1) watermarking success rate, (2) robustness against various corruptions, (3) coding rate of payload information, (4) encoding and decoding efficiency, (5) impacts on the quality of the generated text. To meet the requirements of these non-Pareto-improving metrics, we follow the most prominent vocabulary partition-based watermarking direction, and devise an advanced CTWL method named Balance-Marking. The core idea of our method is to use a proxy language model to split the vocabulary into probability-balanced parts, thereby effectively maintaining the quality of the watermarked text.

Accelerating Quadratic Optimization with Reinforcement Learning,"First-order methods for quadratic optimization such as OSQP are widely used for large-scale machine learning and embedded optimal control, where many related problems must be rapidly solved. These methods face two persistent challenges: manual hyperparameter tuning and convergence time to high-accuracy solutions. To address these, we explore how Reinforcement Learning (RL) can learn a policy to tune parameters to accelerate convergence. In experiments with well-known QP benchmarks we find that our RL policy, RLQP, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art QP solvers by up to 3x. RLQP generalizes surprisingly well to previously unseen problems with varying dimension and structure from different applications, including the QPLIB, Netlib LP and Maros-Meszaros problems. Code for RLQP is available at https://github.com/berkeleyautomation/rlqp.",49,32,4,4,9,78.0,1547.0,24.0,0
PPG Reloaded: An Empirical Study on What Matters in Phasic Policy Gradient,"In model-free reinforcement learning, recent methods based on a phasic policy gradient (PPG) framework have shown impressive improvements in sample efficiency and zero-shot generalization on the challenging Procgen benchmark. In PPG, two design choices are believed to be the key contributing factors to its superior performance over PPO: the high level of value sample reuse and the low frequency of feature distillation. However, through an extensive empirical study, we unveil that policy regularization and data diversity are what actually matters. In particular, we can achieve the same level of performance with low value sample reuse and frequent feature distillation, as long as the policy regularization strength and data diversity are preserved. In addition, we can maintain the high performance of PPG while reducing the computational cost to a similar level as PPO. Our comprehensive study covers all 16 Procgen games in both sample efficiency and generalization setups. We hope it can advance the understanding of PPG and provide insights for future works.",20,0,0,0,4,19.0,1242.0,8.0,0
Spherical CNNs,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the method of choice for learning problems involving 2D planar images. However, a number of problems of recent interest have created a demand for models that can analyze spherical images. Examples include omnidirectional vision for drones, robots, and autonomous cars, molecular regression problems, and global weather and climate modelling. A naive application of convolutional networks to a planar projection of the spherical signal is destined to fail, because the space-varying distortions introduced by such a projection will make translational weight sharing ineffective. In this paper we introduce the building blocks for constructing spherical CNNs. We propose a definition for the spherical cross-correlation that is both expressive and rotation-equivariant. The spherical correlation satisfies a generalized Fourier theorem, which allows us to compute it efficiently using a generalized (non-commutative) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. We demonstrate the computational efficiency, numerical accuracy, and effectiveness of spherical CNNs applied to 3D model recognition and atomization energy regression.",38,851,126,7,4,63.0,8908.0,31.0,1

Estimating Propensity for Causality-based Recommendation without Exposure Data,"Causality-based recommendation systems focus on the causal effects of user-item interactions resulting from item exposure (i.e., which items are recommended or exposed to the user), as opposed to conventional correlation-based recommendation. They are gaining popularity due to their multi-sided benefits to users, sellers and platforms alike. However, existing causality-based recommendation methods require additional input in the form of exposure data and/or propensity scores (i.e., the probability of exposure) for training. Such data, crucial for modeling causality in recommendation, are often not available in real-world situations due to technical or privacy constraints. In this paper, we bridge the gap by proposing a new framework, called Propensity Estimation for Causality-based Recommendation (PropCare). It can estimate the propensity and exposure from a more practical setup, where only interaction data are available without any ground truth on exposure or propensity in training and inference. We demonstrate that, by relating the pairwise characteristics between propensity and item popularity, PropCare enables competitive causality-based recommendation given only the conventional interaction data. We further present a theoretical analysis on the bias of the causal effect under our model estimation. Finally, we empirically evaluate PropCare through both quantitative and qualitative experiments.",42,1,0,2,3,5.0,26.0,2.0,0
Long Live the Lottery: The Existence of Winning Tickets in Lifelong Learning,"The lottery ticket hypothesis states that a highly sparsified sub-network can be trained in isolation, given the appropriate weight initialization. This paper extends that hypothesis from one-shot task leaning, and demonstrates for the first time that such extremely compact and independently trainable sub-networks can be also identified in the lifelong learning scenario, which we call lifelong tickets. We show that the resulting lifelong ticket can further be leveraged to improve the performance of learning over continual tasks. However, it is highly non-trivial to conduct network pruning in the lifelong setting. Two critical roadblocks arise: i) As many tasks now arrive sequentially, finding tickets in a greedy weight pruning fashion will inevitably suffer from the intrinsic bias, that the earlier emerging tasks impact more; ii) As lifelong learning is consistently challenged by catastrophic forgetting, the compact network capacity of tickets might amplify the risk of forgetting. In view of those, we introduce two pruning options, e.g., top-down and bottom-up, for finding lifelong tickets. Compared to the top-down pruning that extends vanilla (iterative) pruning over sequential tasks, we show that the bottomup one, which can dynamically shrink and (re-)expand model capacity, effectively avoids the undesirable excessive pruning in the early stage. We additionally introduce lottery teaching that further overcomes forgetting via knowledge distillation aided by external unlabeled data. Unifying those ingredients, we demonstrate the existence of very competitive lifelong tickets, e.g., achieving 3− 8% of the dense model size with even higher accuracy, compared to strong class-incremental learning baselines on CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100/Tiny-ImageNet datasets.",64,62,7,0,5,118.0,3815.0,34.0,1
On the Variance of Neural Network Training with respect to Test Sets and Distributions,"Typical neural network trainings have substantial variance in test-set performance between repeated runs, impeding hyperparameter comparison and training reproducibility. In this work we present the following results towards understanding this variation. (1) Despite having significant variance on their test-sets, we demonstrate that standard CIFAR-10 and ImageNet trainings have little variance in performance on the underlying test-distributions from which their test-sets are sampled. (2) We show that these trainings make approximately independent errors on their test-sets. That is, the event that a trained network makes an error on one particular example does not affect its chances of making errors on other examples, relative to their average rates over repeated runs of training with the same hyperparameters. (3) We prove that the variance of neural network trainings on their test-sets is a downstream consequence of the class-calibration property discovered by Jiang et al. (2021). Our analysis yields a simple formula which accurately predicts variance for the binary classification case. (4) We conduct preliminary studies of data augmentation, learning rate, finetuning instability and distribution-shift through the lens of variance between runs.",48,7,0,2,1,3.0,88.0,2.0,0
Optimality and Stability in Federated Learning: A Game-theoretic Approach,"Federated learning is a distributed learning paradigm where multiple agents, each only with access to local data, jointly learn a global model. There has recently been an explosion of research aiming not only to improve the accuracy rates of federated learning, but also provide certain guarantees around social good properties such as total error. One branch of this research has taken a game-theoretic approach, and in particular, prior work has viewed federated learning as a hedonic game, where error-minimizing players arrange themselves into federating coalitions. This past work proves the existence of stable coalition partitions, but leaves open a wide range of questions, including how far from optimal these stable solutions are. In this work, we motivate and define a notion of optimality given by the average error rates among federating agents (players). First, we provide and prove the correctness of an efficient algorithm to calculate an optimal (error minimizing) arrangement of players. Next, we analyze the relationship between the stability and optimality of an arrangement. First, we show that for some regions of parameter space, all stable arrangements are optimal (Price of Anarchy equal to 1). However, we show this is not true for all settings: there exist examples of stable arrangements with higher cost than optimal (Price of Anarchy greater than 1). Finally, we give the first constant-factor bound on the performance gap between stability and optimality, proving that the total error of the worst stable solution can be no higher than 9 times the total error of an optimal solution (Price of Anarchy bound of 9).",38,41,1,4,2,11.0,257.0,7.0,0
On the Limitations of Multimodal VAEs,"Multimodal variational autoencoders (VAEs) have shown promise as efficient generative models for weakly-supervised data. Yet, despite their advantage of weak supervision, they exhibit a gap in generative quality compared to unimodal VAEs, which are completely unsupervised. In an attempt to explain this gap, we uncover a fundamental limitation that applies to a large family of mixture-based multimodal VAEs. We prove that the sub-sampling of modalities enforces an undesirable upper bound on the multimodal ELBO and thereby limits the generative quality of the respective models. Empirically, we showcase the generative quality gap on both synthetic and real data and present the tradeoffs between different variants of multimodal VAEs. We find that none of the existing approaches fulfills all desired criteria of an effective multimodal generative model when applied on more complex datasets than those used in previous benchmarks. In summary, we identify, formalize, and validate fundamental limitations of VAE-based approaches for modeling weakly-supervised data and discuss implications for real-world applications.",46,23,6,4,5,21.0,386.0,11.0,0
GriddlyJS: A Web IDE for Reinforcement Learning,"Progress in reinforcement learning (RL) research is often driven by the design of new, challenging environments -- a costly undertaking requiring skills orthogonal to that of a typical machine learning researcher. The complexity of environment development has only increased with the rise of procedural-content generation (PCG) as the prevailing paradigm for producing varied environments capable of testing the robustness and generalization of RL agents. Moreover, existing environments often require complex build processes, making reproducing results difficult. To address these issues, we introduce GriddlyJS, a web-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) based on the Griddly engine. GriddlyJS allows researchers to visually design and debug arbitrary, complex PCG grid-world environments using a convenient graphical interface, as well as visualize, evaluate, and record the performance of trained agent models. By connecting the RL workflow to the advanced functionality enabled by modern web standards, GriddlyJS allows publishing interactive agent-environment demos that reproduce experimental results directly to the web. To demonstrate the versatility of GriddlyJS, we use it to quickly develop a complex compositional puzzle-solving environment alongside arbitrary human-designed environment configurations and their solutions for use in automatic curriculum learning and offline RL. The GriddlyJS IDE is open source and freely available at https://griddly.ai.",77,4,0,3,4,3.0,5.0,1.0,0
All-or-nothing statistical and computational phase transitions in sparse spiked matrix estimation,"We determine statistical and computational limits for estimation of a rank-one matrix (the spike) corrupted by an additive gaussian noise matrix, in a sparse limit, where the underlying hidden vector (that constructs the rank-one matrix) has a number of non-zero components that scales sub-linearly with the total dimension of the vector, and the signal-to-noise ratio tends to infinity at an appropriate speed. We prove explicit low-dimensional variational formulas for the asymptotic mutual information between the spike and the observed noisy matrix and analyze the approximate message passing algorithm in the sparse regime. For Bernoulli and Bernoulli-Rademacher distributed vectors, and when the sparsity and signal strength satisfy an appropriate scaling relation, we find all-or-nothing phase transitions for the asymptotic minimum and algorithmic mean-square errors. These jump from their maximum possible value to zero, at well defined signal-to-noise thresholds whose asymptotic values we determine exactly. In the asymptotic regime the statistical-to-algorithmic gap diverges indicating that sparse recovery is hard for approximate message passing.",74,35,1,5,3,62.0,1944.0,22.0,0
Learning Causal Dynamics Models in Object-Oriented Environments,"Causal dynamics models (CDMs) have demonstrated significant potential in addressing various challenges in reinforcement learning. To learn CDMs, recent studies have performed causal discovery to capture the causal dependencies among environmental variables. However, the learning of CDMs is still confined to small-scale environments due to computational complexity and sample efficiency constraints. This paper aims to extend CDMs to large-scale object-oriented environments, which consist of a multitude of objects classified into different categories. We introduce the Object-Oriented CDM (OOCDM) that shares causalities and parameters among objects belonging to the same class. Furthermore, we propose a learning method for OOCDM that enables it to adapt to a varying number of objects. Experiments on large-scale tasks indicate that OOCDM outperforms existing CDMs in terms of causal discovery, prediction accuracy, generalization, and computational efficiency.",57,1,0,1,3,1.0,1.0,1.0,0
Online mirror descent and dual averaging: keeping pace in the dynamic case,"Online mirror descent (OMD) and dual averaging (DA)---two fundamental algorithms for online convex optimization---are known to have very similar (and sometimes identical) performance guarantees when used with a fixed learning rate. Under dynamic learning rates, however, OMD is provably inferior to DA and suffers a linear regret, even in common settings such as prediction with expert advice. We modify the OMD algorithm through a simple technique that we call stabilization. We give essentially the same abstract regret bound for OMD with stabilization and for DA by modifying the classical OMD convergence analysis in a careful and modular way that allows for straightforward and flexible proofs. Simple corollaries of these bounds show that OMD with stabilization and DA enjoy the same performance guarantees in many applications---even under dynamic learning rates. We also shed light on the similarities between OMD and DA and show simple conditions under which stabilized-OMD and DA generate the same iterates.",36,30,7,5,4,17.0,156.0,8.0,0
The Optimal Approximation Factors in Misspecified Off-Policy Value Function Estimation,"Theoretical guarantees in reinforcement learning (RL) are known to suffer multiplicative blow-up factors with respect to the misspecification error of function approximation. Yet, the nature of such \emph{approximation factors} -- especially their optimal form in a given learning problem -- is poorly understood. In this paper we study this question in linear off-policy value function estimation, where many open questions remain. We study the approximation factor in a broad spectrum of settings, such as with the weighted $L_2$-norm (where the weighting is the offline state distribution), the $L_\infty$ norm, the presence vs. absence of state aliasing, and full vs. partial coverage of the state space. We establish the optimal asymptotic approximation factors (up to constants) for all of these settings. In particular, our bounds identify two instance-dependent factors for the $L_2(\mu)$ norm and only one for the $L_\infty$ norm, which are shown to dictate the hardness of off-policy evaluation under misspecification.",43,2,0,2,3,17.0,236.0,7.0,0
Fixing Implicit Derivatives: Trust-Region Based Learning of Continuous Energy Functions,"We present a new technique for the learning of continuous energy functions that we refer to as Wibergian Learning. One common approach to inverse problems is to cast them as an energy minimisation problem, where the minimum cost solution found is used as an estimator of hidden parameters. Our new approach formally characterises the dependency between weights that control the shape of the energy function, and the location of minima, by describing minima as fixed points of optimisation methods. This allows for the use of gradient-based end-to- end training to integrate deep-learning and the classical inverse problem methods. We show how our approach can be applied to obtain state-of-the-art results in the diverse applications of tracker fusion and multiview 3D reconstruction.",49,6,0,6,3,63.0,4895.0,29.0,0
The Poisson Binomial Mechanism for Unbiased Federated Learning with Secure Aggregation,"We introduce the Poisson Binomial mechanism (PBM), a discrete differential privacy mechanism for distributed mean estimation (DME) with applications to federated learning and analytics. We provide a tight analysis of its privacy guarantees, showing that it achieves the same privacy-accuracy trade-offs as the continuous Gaussian mechanism. Our analysis is based on a novel bound on the R ´ enyi divergence of two Poisson binomial distributions that may be of independent interest. Unlike previous discrete DP schemes based on additive noise, our mechanism encodes local information into a parameter of the binomial distribution, and hence the output distribution is discrete with bounded support. Moreover, the support does not increase as the privacy budget ε → 0 as in the case of additive schemes which require the addition of more noise to achieve higher privacy; on the contrary, the support becomes smaller as ε → 0 . The bounded support enables us to combine our mechanism with secure aggregation (SecAgg), a multi-party cryptographic protocol, without the need of performing modular clipping which results in an unbiased estimator of the sum of the local vectors. This in turn allows us to apply it in the private FL setting and provide an upper bound on the convergence rate of the SGD algo-rithm. Moreover, since the support of the output distribution becomes smaller as ε → 0 , the communication cost of our scheme decreases with the privacy constraint ε , outperforming all previous distributed DP schemes based on additive noise in the high privacy or low communication regimes.",39,41,7,0,3,29.0,444.0,10.0,1
Continuous-Time Analysis of Accelerated Gradient Methods via Conservation Laws in Dilated Coordinate Systems,"We analyze continuous-time models of accelerated gradient methods through deriving conservation laws in dilated coordinate systems. Namely, instead of analyzing the dynamics of $X(t)$, we analyze the dynamics of $W(t)=t^\alpha(X(t)-X_c)$ for some $\alpha$ and $X_c$ and derive a conserved quantity, analogous to physical energy, in this dilated coordinate system. Through this methodology, we recover many known continuous-time analyses in a streamlined manner and obtain novel continuous-time analyses for OGM-G, an acceleration mechanism for efficiently reducing gradient magnitude that is distinct from that of Nesterov. Finally, we show that a semi-second-order symplectic Euler discretization in the dilated coordinate system leads to an $\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ rate on the standard setup of smooth convex minimization, without any further assumptions such as infinite differentiability.",109,12,3,3,3,39.0,240.0,7.0,0
Beyond Alternating Updates for Matrix Factorization with Inertial Bregman Proximal Gradient Algorithms,"Matrix Factorization is a popular non-convex optimization problem, for which alternating minimization schemes are mostly used. They usually suffer from the major drawback that the solution is biased towards one of the optimization variables. A remedy is non-alternating schemes. However, due to a lack of Lipschitz continuity of the gradient in matrix factorization problems, convergence cannot be guaranteed. A recently developed approach relies on the concept of Bregman distances, which generalizes the standard Euclidean distance. We exploit this theory by proposing a novel Bregman distance for matrix factorization problems, which, at the same time, allows for simple/closed form update steps. Therefore, for non-alternating schemes, such as the recently introduced Bregman Proximal Gradient (BPG) method and an inertial variant Convex--Concave Inertial BPG (CoCaIn BPG), convergence of the whole sequence to a stationary point is proved for Matrix Factorization. In several experiments, we observe a superior performance of our non-alternating schemes in terms of speed and objective value at the limit point.",67,19,1,6,2,8.0,469.0,6.0,0
Random Shuffling Beats SGD Only After Many Epochs on Ill-Conditioned Problems,"Recently, there has been much interest in studying the convergence rates of without-replacement SGD, and proving that it is faster than with-replacement SGD in the worst case. However, known lower bounds ignore the problem's geometry, including its condition number, whereas the upper bounds explicitly depend on it. Perhaps surprisingly, we prove that when the condition number is taken into account, without-replacement SGD \emph{does not} significantly improve on with-replacement SGD in terms of worst-case bounds, unless the number of epochs (passes over the data) is larger than the condition number. Since many problems in machine learning and other areas are both ill-conditioned and involve large datasets, this indicates that without-replacement does not necessarily improve over with-replacement sampling for realistic iteration budgets. We show this by providing new lower and upper bounds which are tight (up to log factors), for quadratic problems with commuting quadratic terms, precisely quantifying the dependence on the problem parameters.",25,17,3,4,2,15.0,872.0,11.0,0
Batched Thompson Sampling,"We introduce a novel anytime Batched Thompson sampling policy for multi-armed bandits where the agent observes the rewards of her actions and adjusts her policy only at the end of a small number of batches. We show that this policy simultaneously achieves a problem dependent regret of order $O(\log(T))$ and a minimax regret of order $O(\sqrt{T\log(T)})$ while the number of batches can be bounded by $O(\log(T))$ independent of the problem instance over a time horizon $T$. We also show that in expectation the number of batches used by our policy can be bounded by an instance dependent bound of order $O(\log\log(T))$. These results indicate that Thompson sampling maintains the same performance in this batched setting as in the case when instantaneous feedback is available after each action, while requiring minimal feedback. These results also indicate that Thompson sampling performs competitively with recently proposed algorithms tailored for the batched setting. These algorithms optimize the batch structure for a given time horizon $T$ and prioritize exploration in the beginning of the experiment to eliminate suboptimal actions. We show that Thompson sampling combined with an adaptive batching strategy can achieve a similar performance without knowing the time horizon $T$ of the problem and without having to carefully optimize the batch structure to achieve a target regret bound (i.e. problem dependent vs minimax regret) for a given $T$.",28,15,1,4,2,6.0,30.0,4.0,0
Image Restoration with Mean-Reverting Stochastic Differential Equations,"This paper presents a stochastic differential equation (SDE) approach for general-purpose image restoration. The key construction consists in a mean-reverting SDE that transforms a high-quality image into a degraded counterpart as a mean state with fixed Gaussian noise. Then, by simulating the corresponding reverse-time SDE, we are able to restore the origin of the low-quality image without relying on any task-specific prior knowledge. Crucially, the proposed mean-reverting SDE has a closed-form solution, allowing us to compute the ground truth time-dependent score and learn it with a neural network. Moreover, we propose a maximum likelihood objective to learn an optimal reverse trajectory that stabilizes the training and improves the restoration results. The experiments show that our proposed method achieves highly competitive performance in quantitative comparisons on image deraining, deblurring, and denoising, setting a new state-of-the-art on two deraining datasets. Finally, the general applicability of our approach is further demonstrated via qualitative results on image super-resolution, inpainting, and dehazing.

Controllable Unsupervised Text Attribute Transfer via Editing Entangled Latent Representation,"Unsupervised text attribute transfer automatically transforms a text to alter a specific attribute (e.g. sentiment) without using any parallel data, while simultaneously preserving its attribute-independent content. The dominant approaches are trying to model the content-independent attribute separately, e.g., learning different attributes' representations or using multiple attribute-specific decoders. However, it may lead to inflexibility from the perspective of controlling the degree of transfer or transferring over multiple aspects at the same time. To address the above problems, we propose a more flexible unsupervised text attribute transfer framework which replaces the process of modeling attribute with minimal editing of latent representations based on an attribute classifier. Specifically, we first propose a Transformer-based autoencoder to learn an entangled latent representation for a discrete text, then we transform the attribute transfer task to an optimization problem and propose the Fast-Gradient-Iterative-Modification algorithm to edit the latent representation until conforming to the target attribute. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves very competitive performance on three public data sets. Furthermore, we also show that our model can not only control the degree of transfer freely but also allow to transfer over multiple aspects at the same time.",45,86,18,6,3,9.0,388.0,6.0,0
Transformer-Patcher: One Mistake worth One Neuron,"Large Transformer-based Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) dominate almost all Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Nevertheless, they still make mistakes from time to time. For a model deployed in an industrial environment, fixing these mistakes quickly and robustly is vital to improve user experiences. Previous works formalize such problems as Model Editing (ME) and mostly focus on fixing one mistake. However, the one-mistake-fixing scenario is not an accurate abstraction of the real-world challenge. In the deployment of AI services, there are ever-emerging mistakes, and the same mistake may recur if not corrected in time. Thus a preferable solution is to rectify the mistakes as soon as they appear nonstop. Therefore, we extend the existing ME into Sequential Model Editing (SME) to help develop more practical editing methods. Our study shows that most current ME methods could yield unsatisfying results in this scenario. We then introduce Transformer-Patcher, a novel model editor that can shift the behavior of transformer-based models by simply adding and training a few neurons in the last Feed-Forward Network layer. Experimental results on both classification and generation tasks show that Transformer-Patcher can successively correct up to thousands of errors (Reliability) and generalize to their equivalent inputs (Generality) while retaining the model's accuracy on irrelevant inputs (Locality). Our method outperforms previous fine-tuning and HyperNetwork-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance for Sequential Model Editing (SME).

Two Simple Ways to Learn Individual Fairness Metrics from Data,"Individual fairness is an intuitive definition of algorithmic fairness that addresses some of the drawbacks of group fairness. Despite its benefits, it depends on a task specific fair metric that encodes our intuition of what is fair and unfair for the ML task at hand, and the lack of a widely accepted fair metric for many ML tasks is the main barrier to broader adoption of individual fairness. In this paper, we present two simple ways to learn fair metrics from a variety of data types. We show empirically that fair training with the learned metrics leads to improved fairness on three machine learning tasks susceptible to gender and racial biases. We also provide theoretical guarantees on the statistical performance of both approaches.",63,91,7,5,4,23.0,303.0,7.0,0
CoCo: A Coupled Contrastive Framework for Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Graph Classification,"Although graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive achievements in graph classification, they often need abundant task-specific labels, which could be extensively costly to acquire. A credible solution is to explore additional labeled graphs to enhance unsupervised learning on the target domain. However, how to apply GNNs to domain adaptation remains unsolved owing to the insufficient exploration of graph topology and the significant domain discrepancy. In this paper, we propose Coupled Contrastive Graph Representation Learning (CoCo), which extracts the topological information from coupled learning branches and reduces the domain discrepancy with coupled contrastive learning. CoCo contains a graph convolutional network branch and a hierarchical graph kernel network branch, which explore graph topology in implicit and explicit manners. Besides, we incorporate coupled branches into a holistic multi-view contrastive learning framework, which not only incorporates graph representations learned from complementary views for enhanced understanding, but also encourages the similarity between cross-domain example pairs with the same semantics for domain alignment. Extensive experiments on popular datasets show that our CoCo outperforms these competing baselines in different settings generally.",81,35,3,2,8,10.0,160.0,7.0,1
The Privacy Power of Correlated Noise in Decentralized Learning,"Decentralized learning is appealing as it enables the scalable usage of large amounts of distributed data and resources (without resorting to any central entity), while promoting privacy since every user minimizes the direct exposure of their data. Yet, without additional precautions, curious users can still leverage models obtained from their peers to violate privacy. In this paper, we propose Decor, a variant of decentralized SGD with differential privacy (DP) guarantees. Essentially, in Decor, users securely exchange randomness seeds in one communication round to generate pairwise-canceling correlated Gaussian noises, which are injected to protect local models at every communication round. We theoretically and empirically show that, for arbitrary connected graphs, Decor matches the central DP optimal privacy-utility trade-off. We do so under SecLDP, our new relaxation of local DP, which protects all user communications against an external eavesdropper and curious users, assuming that every pair of connected users shares a secret, i.e., an information hidden to all others. The main theoretical challenge is to control the accumulation of non-canceling correlated noise due to network sparsity. We also propose a companion SecLDP privacy accountant for public use.",49,3,0,1,5,13.0,79.0,4.0,0
Adversarial Robustness with Non-uniform Perturbations,"Robustness of machine learning models is critical for security related applications, where real-world adversaries are uniquely focused on evading neural network based detectors. Prior work mainly focus on crafting adversarial examples (AEs) with small uniform norm-bounded perturbations across features to maintain the requirement of imperceptibility. However, uniform perturbations do not result in realistic AEs in domains such as malware, finance, and social networks. For these types of applications, features typically have some semantically meaningful dependencies. The key idea of our proposed approach is to enable non-uniform perturbations that can adequately represent these feature dependencies during adversarial training. We propose using characteristics of the empirical data distribution, both on correlations between the features and the importance of the features themselves. Using experimental datasets for malware classification, credit risk prediction, and spam detection, we show that our approach is more robust to real-world attacks. Finally, we present robustness certification utilizing non-uniform perturbation bounds, and show that non-uniform bounds achieve better certification.",49,23,1,4,4,16.0,204.0,8.0,0
Multi-Agent Meta-Reinforcement Learning: Sharper Convergence Rates with Task Similarity,"Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has primarily focused on solving a single task in isolation, while in practice the environment is often evolving, leaving many related tasks to be solved. In this paper, we investigate the benefits of meta-learning in solving multiple MARL tasks collectively. We establish the first line of theoretical results for meta-learning in a wide range of fundamental MARL settings, including learning Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum Markov games and Markov potential games, as well as learning coarse correlated equilibria in general-sum Markov games. Under natural notions of task similarity, we show that meta-learning achieves provable sharper convergence to various game-theoretical solution concepts than learning each task separately. As an important intermediate step, we develop multiple MARL algorithms with initialization-dependent convergence guarantees. Such algorithms integrate optimistic policy mirror descents with stage-based value updates, and their refined convergence guarantees (nearly) recover the best known results even when a good initialization is unknown. To our best knowledge, such results are also new and might be of independent interest. We further provide numerical simulations to corroborate our theoretical findings.",78,2,0,0,7,32.0,379.0,11.0,0
Privacy Amplification by Subsampling: Tight Analyses via Couplings and Divergences,"Differential privacy comes equipped with multiple analytical tools for the design of private data analyses. One important tool is the so-called ""privacy amplification by subsampling"" principle, which ensures that a differentially private mechanism run on a random subsample of a population provides higher privacy guarantees than when run on the entire population. Several instances of this principle have been studied for different random subsampling methods, each with an ad-hoc analysis. In this paper we present a general method that recovers and improves prior analyses, yields lower bounds and derives new instances of privacy amplification by subsampling. Our method leverages a characterization of differential privacy as a divergence which emerged in the program verification community. Furthermore, it introduces new tools, including advanced joint convexity and privacy profiles, which might be of independent interest.",31,354,41,7,3,95.0,5617.0,32.0,1
On the Global Convergence of Gradient Descent for Over-parameterized Models using Optimal Transport,"Many tasks in machine learning and signal processing can be solved by minimizing a convex function of a measure. This includes sparse spikes deconvolution or training a neural network with a single hidden layer. For these problems, we study a simple minimization method: the unknown measure is discretized into a mixture of particles and a continuous-time gradient descent is performed on their weights and positions. This is an idealization of the usual way to train neural networks with a large hidden layer. We show that, when initialized correctly and in the many-particle limit, this gradient flow, although non-convex, converges to global minimizers. The proof involves Wasserstein gradient flows, a by-product of optimal transport theory. Numerical experiments show that this asymptotic behavior is already at play for a reasonable number of particles, even in high dimension.",45,676,82,7,2,42.0,3659.0,19.0,1
Beyond Pretrained Features: Noisy Image Modeling Provides Adversarial Defense,"Recent advancements in masked image modeling (MIM) have made it a prevailing framework for self-supervised visual representation learning. The MIM pretrained models, like most deep neural network methods, are still vulnerable to adversarial attacks, limiting their practical application, and this issue has received little research attention. In this paper, we investigate how this powerful self-supervised learning paradigm can provide adversarial robustness to downstream classifiers. During the exploration, we find that noisy image modeling (NIM), a simple variant of MIM that adopts denoising as the pre-text task, reconstructs noisy images surprisingly well despite severe corruption. Motivated by this observation, we propose an adversarial defense method by exploiting the pretrained decoder for denoising, referred to as De^3, through which NIM is able to enhance adversarial robustness beyond providing pretrained features. Furthermore, we incorporate a simple modification, sampling the noise scale hyperparameter from random distributions, and enable the defense to achieve a better and tunable trade-off between accuracy and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that, in terms of adversarial robustness, NIM is superior compared to MIM thanks to its effective denoising capability. Moreover, the defense provided by NIM achieves performance on par with adversarial training while offering the extra tunability advantage. Source code and models will be made available.",46,2,0,2,3,4.0,25.0,3.0,0
Neural Basis Models for Interpretability,"Due to the widespread use of complex machine learning models in real-world applications, it is becoming critical to explain model predictions. However, these models are typically black-box deep neural networks, explained post-hoc via methods with known faithfulness limitations. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are an inherently interpretable class of models that address this limitation by learning a non-linear shape function for each feature separately, followed by a linear model on top. However, these models are typically difficult to train, require numerous parameters, and are difficult to scale. We propose an entirely new subfamily of GAMs that utilizes basis decomposition of shape functions. A small number of basis functions are shared among all features, and are learned jointly for a given task, thus making our model scale much better to large-scale data with high-dimensional features, especially when features are sparse. We propose an architecture denoted as the Neural Basis Model (NBM) which uses a single neural network to learn these bases. On a variety of tabular and image datasets, we demonstrate that for interpretable machine learning, NBMs are the state-of-the-art in accuracy, model size, and, throughput and can easily model all higher-order feature interactions.

Reinforcement Learning for Control with Multiple Frequencies,"Many real-world sequential decision problems involve multiple action variables whose control frequencies are different, such that actions take their effects at different periods. While these problems can be formulated with the notion of multiple action persistences in factored-action MDP (FA-MDP), it is non-trivial to solve them efﬁciently since an action-persistent policy constructed from a stationary policy can be arbitrarily suboptimal, rendering solution methods for the standard FA-MDPs hardly applicable. In this paper, we formalize the problem of multiple control frequencies in RL and provide its efﬁcient solution method. Our proposed method, Action-Persistent Policy Iteration (AP-PI), provides a theoretical guarantee on the convergence to an optimal solution while incurring only a factor of |A| increase in time complexity during policy improvement step, compared to the standard policy iteration for FA-MDPs. Extending this result, we present Action-Persistent Actor-Critic (AP-AC), a scalable RL algorithm for high-dimensional control tasks. In the experiments, we demonstrate that AP-AC signiﬁcantly out-performs the baselines on several continuous control tasks and a trafﬁc control simulation, which highlights the effectiveness of our method that directly optimizes the periodic non-stationary policy for tasks with multiple control frequencies.",30,16,1,0,3,23.0,526.0,13.0,0
Online learning of quantum states,"Suppose we have many copies of an unknown n-qubit state . We measure some copies of using a known two-outcome measurement E1, then other copies using a measurement E2, and so on. At each stage t, we generate a current hypothesis about the state , using the outcomes of the previous measurements. We show that it is possible to do this in a way that guarantees that , the error in our prediction for the next measurement, is at least at most times. Even in the ‘non-realizable’ setting—where there could be arbitrary noise in the measurement outcomes—we show how to output hypothesis states that incur at most excess loss over the best possible state on the first T measurements. These results generalize a 2007 theorem by Aaronson on the PAC-learnability of quantum states, to the online and regret-minimization settings. We give three different ways to prove our results—using convex optimization, quantum postselection, and sequential fat-shattering dimension—which have different advantages in terms of parameters and portability.",33,90,9,7,4,186.0,10391.0,47.0,0
Adversarial Self-Training Improves Robustness and Generalization for Gradual Domain Adaptation,"Gradual Domain Adaptation (GDA), in which the learner is provided with additional intermediate domains, has been theoretically and empirically studied in many contexts. Despite its vital role in security-critical scenarios, the adversarial robustness of the GDA model remains unexplored. In this paper, we adopt the effective gradual self-training method and replace vanilla self-training with adversarial self-training (AST). AST first predicts labels on the unlabeled data and then adversarially trains the model on the pseudo-labeled distribution. Intriguingly, we find that gradual AST improves not only adversarial accuracy but also clean accuracy on the target domain. We reveal that this is because adversarial training (AT) performs better than standard training when the pseudo-labels contain a portion of incorrect labels. Accordingly, we first present the generalization error bounds for gradual AST in a multiclass classification setting. We then use the optimal value of the Subset Sum Problem to bridge the standard error on a real distribution and the adversarial error on a pseudo-labeled distribution. The result indicates that AT may obtain a tighter bound than standard training on data with incorrect pseudo-labels. We further present an example of a conditional Gaussian distribution to provide more insights into why gradual AST can improve the clean accuracy for GDA.",56,9,1,0,2,2.0,10.0,1.0,0
Code Generation as a Dual Task of Code Summarization,"Code summarization (CS) and code generation (CG) are two crucial tasks in the field of automatic software development. Various neural network-based approaches are proposed to solve these two tasks separately. However, there exists a specific intuitive correlation between CS and CG, which has not been exploited in previous work. In this paper, we apply the relations between two tasks to improve the performance of both tasks. In other words, exploiting the duality between the two tasks, we propose a dual training framework to train the two tasks simultaneously. In this framework, we consider the dualities on probability and attention weights, and design corresponding regularization terms to constrain the duality. We evaluate our approach on two datasets collected from GitHub, and experimental results show that our dual framework can improve the performance of CS and CG tasks over baselines.",28,208,24,6,5,16.0,537.0,8.0,1
Conditional Gradient Methods via Stochastic Path-Integrated Differential Estimator,"We propose a class of novel variance-reduced stochastic conditional gradient methods. By adopting the recent stochastic path-integrated differential estimator technique (SPIDER) of Fang et al. (2018) for the classical Frank-Wolfe (FW) method, we introduce SPIDER-FW for finite-sum minimization as well as the more general expectation minimization problems. SPIDER-FW enjoys superior complexity guarantees in the non-convex setting, while matching the best known FW variants in the convex case. We also extend our framework à la conditional gradient sliding (CGS) of Lan & Zhou (2016), and propose SPIDER-CGS.",28,43,11,6,3,35.0,1076.0,15.0,0
Towards Green AI in Fine-tuning Large Language Models via Adaptive Backpropagation,"Fine-tuning is the most effective way of adapting pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to downstream applications. With the fast growth of LLM-enabled AI applications and democratization of open-souced LLMs, fine-tuning has become possible for non-expert individuals, but intensively performed LLM fine-tuning worldwide could result in significantly high energy consumption and carbon footprint, which may bring large environmental impact. Mitigating such environmental impact towards Green AI directly correlates to reducing the FLOPs of fine-tuning, but existing techniques on efficient LLM fine-tuning can only achieve limited reduction of such FLOPs, due to their ignorance of the backpropagation cost in fine-tuning. To address this limitation, in this paper we present GreenTrainer, a new LLM fine-tuning technique that adaptively evaluates different tensors' backpropagation costs and contributions to the fine-tuned model accuracy, to minimize the fine-tuning cost by selecting the most appropriate set of tensors in training. Such selection in GreenTrainer is made based on a given objective of FLOPs reduction, which can flexibly adapt to the carbon footprint in energy supply and the need in Green AI. Experiment results over multiple open-sourced LLM models and abstractive summarization datasets show that, compared to fine-tuning the whole LLM model, GreenTrainer can save up to 64% FLOPs in fine-tuning without any noticeable model accuracy loss. Compared to the existing fine-tuning techniques such as LoRa, GreenTrainer can achieve up to 4% improvement on model accuracy with on-par FLOPs reduction.",55,4,0,2,4,14.0,102.0,5.0,0
Speculative Decoding with Big Little Decoder,"The recent emergence of Large Language Models based on the Transformer architecture has enabled dramatic advancements in the field of Natural Language Processing. However, these models have long inference latency, which limits their deployment and makes them prohibitively expensive for various real-time applications. The inference latency is further exacerbated by autoregressive generative tasks, as models need to run iteratively to generate tokens sequentially without leveraging token-level parallelization. To address this, we propose Big Little Decoder (BiLD), a framework that can improve inference efficiency and latency for a wide range of text generation applications. The BiLD framework contains two models with different sizes that collaboratively generate text. The small model runs autoregressively to generate text with a low inference cost, and the large model is only invoked occasionally to refine the small model's inaccurate predictions in a non-autoregressive manner. To coordinate the small and large models, BiLD introduces two simple yet effective policies: (1) the fallback policy that determines when to hand control over to the large model; and (2) the rollback policy that determines when the large model needs to correct the small model's inaccurate predictions. To evaluate our framework across different tasks and models, we apply BiLD to various text generation scenarios encompassing machine translation on IWSLT 2017 De-En and WMT 2014 De-En, and summarization on XSUM and CNN/DailyMail. On an NVIDIA T4 GPU, our framework achieves a speedup of up to 2.12x speedup with minimal generation quality degradation. Furthermore, our framework is fully plug-and-play and can be applied without any modifications in the training process or model architecture. Our code is open-sourced",84,63,4,2,7,20.0,2089.0,15.0,1
